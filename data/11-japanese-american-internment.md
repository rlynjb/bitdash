# Japanese American Internment

After the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, the U.S. government forcibly relocated and incarcerated over 2,300 Japanese Americans from San Francisco into internment camps. This dark chapter led to later civil rights redress and is memorialized at sites like the Presidioâ€™s Fort McDowell.
