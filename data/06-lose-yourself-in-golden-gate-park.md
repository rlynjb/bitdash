# Lose Yourself in Golden Gate Park

Spanning over 1,000 acres, the park houses the de Young Museum, California Academy of Sciences (with its rainforest dome, planetarium, and aquarium), Japanese Tea Garden, and miles of bike paths and hidden gardens. Donâ€™t miss a paddleboat ride on Stow Lake or a picnic on the Polo Fields.
