# Soak Up Mission District Culture

Start with a mural-studded walk down Clarion Alley, then try a Mission-style burrito at one of the taquerias along 24th Street. Browse indie bookstores, coffee shops, and vintage clothing stores as you discover the neighborhoodâ€™s vibrant Latino heritage and cutting-edge arts scene.
