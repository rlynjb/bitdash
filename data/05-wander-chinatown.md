# Wander Chinatown

Enter through the Dragon Gate on Grant Avenue, then explore narrow alleys lined with herbal shops, dim-sum restaurants, and bakeries. Pop into the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory for a behind-the-scenes look at how these little treats are made, then sample hand-pulled noodles at a neighborhood noodle house.
