# Hike the Lands End Trail

Follow a cliffside path past cypress groves and shipwreck ruins to the Eagleâ€™s Point labyrinth, where you can gaze out over Seal Rock and the Pacific. The trailhead at the Sutro Baths ruins is a great spot to explore tide pools and learn about this once-lavish Victorian bathhouse.
